        <!-- About me-->
        <h1>HBO-ICT at HZ University</h1>
        <p>Hey welcome!! </p>
        <p>My name is Milton, I am a student at HZ University of Applied sciences</p>
        <!-- Information about HZ university and study course-->
        <h2>Why HZ University?</h2>
        <img src="resources/hzbuilding.jfif" width="300" height="150" />
        <p>HZ University offers students one of the most practical educational programs you could get out there. at HZ
          University not only are you getting premium education, you are also getting a well recognised certificate
          because HZ ranks as one if the best universities in the Netherlands and in Europe</p>
        <p>HZ also has so many partnerships with universities and companies locally and worldwide so your internships
          and minors can be done locally and internationally, all this at one of the most cost effective programs in the
          world. At HZ, you get your money's worth of education and experience and fun all in one package called the
          HBO-ICT program, and that is what i believe is the STUDENT DREAM </p>
        <h3>Why the HBO-ICT program </h3>
        <img src="resources/hboict.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
        <p>The HBO-ICT program is as practical as practical can get. ICT in general is the cream on the pie for computer
          enthusiasts because it requires little to no previous knowledge in computer science and most importantly math
          and physics. The ICT program just requires you to love learning and doing with an open mind. The program
          structure gives students alot of room to be flexible and share their thoughts and ideas and also develop their
          personality </p>
        <p>The past 2 weeks and also my background in ICT(which i started doing in high school and for the last 3 years
          University), has made me see and love the challenge that comes with creating something visual that is non
          tangible but can change people's lives. ICT and computer engineers are the closest to magicians in the real
          world. I love being a magician </p>

      <!-- reasons ICT suites me-->
      <h4 class="reasons">Reasons ICT suits me</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I love learning while doing.</li>
        <li>Being able to create new things such as software, apps, websites soothe me. The joy I get from code running
          succesfully is second to none.</li>
        <li>The courses taught and the career path choices offered match with my dreams and aspirations</li>
        <li>With this program, i am going to have a full CV before i graduate, maybe even a job because of the
          practicality of the program.</li>
