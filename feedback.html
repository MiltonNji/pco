    <h1>Feedback and Thoughts</h1>
    <h2>Feedback I had from the SKC assignment</h2>
    <p class="ans">Hey Milton, welcome to the study program. Great to read your motivation for the subject IT. One question that came to mind when reading your study choice motivation is what in IT speaks so much to you? Now you are simply saying your like IT as a whole. It's good to think about which part of IT you like so much. Programming, Teamwork, problem solving etc.<br><br>

        You also write about not knowing exactly what you want to do in the field of IT after completing your study. It's good to see that you realize you need to understand the subject/field more before making an informed decision.<br><br>
        
        In the SWOT-analysis you describe yourself as having a positive mindset and some confidence. You also know your limits around patience with peers. Have you thought about ways to manage this in een team setting.  You'll get to reflect on subjects like this later in the study so it's good to start thinking about it.<br><br>
        
        Anyways, just keep these thing in mind since you will need them for your personal development and the motivation section on your first website.<br><br>
        
        Kind regards,
        
        Gijs</p>
    <h3>Thoughts about the feedback</h3>
    <p class="ans">I said i like IT as whole because i am interested in the all of the aspects Gijs mentioned and so much more. I am a problem solver who likes programming, I am not really good at it but i really do love it, also i love the magic you feel when yiu create something with a computer.<br><br> I love teams but my past experiences with team members are made up of instances where i  have done all the work supposed to be done. I am however positive at HZ it will be different.
